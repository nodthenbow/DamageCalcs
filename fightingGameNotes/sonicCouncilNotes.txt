Sonic Council notes
System:
crouch hitstun is more than standing sometimes (standing hitstun works as expected), see below
crouch hitstun hurtboxes can shrink real low, see below
the amount of juggle frames you get are different against kumiko (only?), see crouch stuff below
P+K to guard cancel roll
4/6 on wakeup to getup roll, also delays the wakeup by 9f
Scaling is wack, see below
669/8/7 carries momentum and is sometimes a lower jump
screen scrolls slowly, when you reach the edge pushback acts like it is the corner
the first move in a combo can have different pushback than the same move in a combo
backdashes have iframes
a lot of moves are the same advantage on hit and block, it's arbitrary though
characters reel during hitstun which can cause whiffs, especially for lows when back turned
air flip out juggles seem to have 7 frames of hitstun universally
Stun is on almost everything, takes 800ish units to stun, see health/stun table below. 
mashing out of stun is a thing 
you can only be stunned once in a round
stun damage decreases by 1 every 4 frames, only stops in screen freeze/hitstop (global 4f timer)
hitting someone on the frame they take off from a jump causes the game to try to use the standing hit reel as the juggle hit effect, which can sometimes mean the wrong juggle effect comes out
Hitting T-Ai with Ishida's 214pp as she gets hit with her own 263kk drops her out of the 214pp while still taking damage. It softlocks the game if it kills
wakeup roll adds 9 frames to the knockdown (for everyone, and for both directions)
getups are not all the same length, see below
chain buffer for buttons starts with the active frame, doesn't need the button held
it determines the direction input right before when the move comes out
link buffer is at least 4 frames
if you just frame the final input of a special it doesn't go into the cancel buffer 
(623hp can be input early and still cancel, 623+hp can't be input early)
buffer window is 7f (if you don't just frame a special input), so 8f window total for most things
tk inputs are done on the 4th frame after pressing up (so 8,w,w,w,P) (at least for ishida and rika)
instant rising jump normals can be input on the same frame as you press up
2f jumpsquat, 1f wait, then rising jump normals start
the 4th frame after a jump can be canceled into grounded specials, so tk takes 1f longer
you also need to wait that extra frame on tk or you'll do an air normal instead of the special anyways
dash jumps skip the 2f jumpsquat
dash startup is 5f
667 must be input without hitting 4 or 8 (unless it is in the first 5f of the dash)


Getup stuff:
face down is (rika 2hp, 0 is +45):
	Ai -1
	Aya +1
	Naoko +1
	Rika +2
	Kumiko -1
	Shibata -3
face up is (kato 2hk):
	kato 56
	ishida 59
	naoko 58
	mika 53
	ai 61
	yuko 56
	aya 58
	rika 59
	kumiko 60
	shibata 59
this difference might be related to landing height differences between characters 
(T-Ai and S-Naoko are the same as their regular versions)


Crouch Stuff:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBhuhJMCrX1iMZBhXbhkfevynueO_iShj7ptp2grFf8/edit?usp=sharing
General rule is lights get +6 vs crouch, uppercut and dunks get +2
Against Kumiko lights instead get +4, and mediums get -2, and half gutshots get -2
For Ishida's 66lk-hk (and 66lk-mp-hk) chain (midscreen):
Works on Kato, Ishida, Mika, Yuko, and Rika
Doesn't work on Naoko, Ai, and Kumiko
Crouch hurtbox often lowers during hitstun, causes ishida 66hk to whiff even off 66mp
kumiko 426lk juggles for 2 less frames vs kumiko, rika 66hk juggles for 1 more vs kumiko


Scaling:
the game rounds weird, or all the scaling values are like 0.001 less
to calculate damage, use floor(baseDamage*(scalingValue-0.001))
(that isn't the in game formula, but it works out the same afaik)
scaling is based on cancels, it does not care about being in or out of a combo
link = no scaling (including juggles)
chain 1 = 0.65
chain 2+ = 0.60
(ex: lp chain mp chain hp chain hk, lp does 100%, mp does 65%, hp does 60%, hk does 60%)
cancel = 0.90
normal xx super = 0.70
special xx super = 0.80
for ishida's rekka every cancel is an additional 0.10 lower
(ex: normal xx 236lk xx 236mk xx 236hk does 1, 0.90, 0.80, 0.70)


Gameplay/Combos:
Rika:
2lk 5mp 2hp, can add a 2mk vs standing, can start with 2lp 2lk for extra punish damage
2lk 5mp 5hp 236pp, can start with 2lp, skip 5hp on cr miku/rika
5lk instead of 2lk after jump ins
66mk-hk or just 66hk 662 delay 5mk 623lp
66lp combos into lights 
6mp unblockable, chain into 2mk 2hp
66lp/lk/mp/mk, lp/lk/2lp/2lk, j214p, 28-2hk, +ob
5hp 0ob/0oh (vs stand)
everything else (other than jump ins) -oh and -ob
2147hp is i13 at the fastest (counting from 7)

Ishida:
lk 2mp mk 236lk 214pp
lk 2mp mk 236lk 236mk 236hk vs most, some dodge the 236mk when crouching
2369hk quick +++ob overhead
2369lk mid +1ob-ish, also +1oh-ish, can cancel into j236hk for big plus frames
66hk overhead --ob 
basically no reversal (236mk not, 214p mid/high only (also maybe not i1))
214PP invuln until hit, first hit does no damage though so it trades terribly
236K cancels into other specials, works on block
has 4mk 6mk 6hk cmd normals
vs crouch (not kumiko) 2369lk-236hk 2lp 5lk link 214pp
vs stand 2369lk-236hk 2lp 5lk 5mp 5mk 236lk 214pp
vs crouch (not kumiko) (66lk 5lk)*inf, drops on some midscreen (3f window each 66lk) (does 350ish stun)
vs stand blah hp 66lk-mp-hk 66hp/623kk
you can do j236lk-236hk infinitely if you are clean with it (2f window on each j236lk)

Ai
throw 6623hp
throw hp better oki, less damage
623hp xx 263kk 623hp
crn 2lp 5lk 2mp 623lp 2lp 2lk 2hp 623hp (2hp(1) and skip 2lp vs some)
throw walk lk 623hp vs some 
mash p requires 4x of the same p input to trigger with no other buttons between them
623hp xx 263kk slight delay (or late xx 263kk) 5lk xx 623hp 
623hp xx 263kk cancel window is 5f (+8f of a buffer window, so 13f total leniency)
for some reason 263kk uses a hitbox then a throw box, but the throw box seems to hit always?

Traitor Ai
Same as Ai mostly, except:
Everything cancels and chains
236K and 263KK are different
236KK replaces j623PP
throw 66mp623hp

Yuko
crn 66lp-lk-mp-mk-hk xx 28hp 2mk28mp vs tall, do 28mp both times vs others
crn 2lk 2mk 28mp 2mk 28mp
crn stand jhk 5hp 2mk 28mp 2mk 28mp 

Kato
214kk has iframes, but not on frame 1
236lk is 18 frames total (19 maybe?)
66lp-lk-mp-mk 2lp5hp2hk, 241 damage
vs tall crouchers lights into 5hp

Naoko
vs crouching kato 2lp5mp 2lp 6 lkmpmkhphk236lp, 300 damage
vs crouching shibata 2lp5mp 2lp5mpmkhphk236lp, 282 damage
vs crouching aya 2lp5mp 2lk2mk2hk, 124 damage

Shibata
2mp2hp works on standing hit
236hp is +8 on block and +1 on gc roll


Frame data from lua script:
Meter updates 1f before hit reactions, all startup may be 1 more than it really is
all grounded recovery forces one frame of neutral (or neutral crouch) at the end (you can block in this)
animations play 2f after the game logic updates
dash takes 5f before it can attack (this is not included in the startup)
jumpsquat is 2f+1f wait, +1 more for tk specials
