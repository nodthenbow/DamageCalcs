Sonic Council notes
System:
crouch hitstun is more than standing sometimes (standing hitstun works as expected), see below
crouch hitstun hurtboxes can shrink real low, see below
the amount of juggle frames you get are different against different characters, see crouch stuff below
P+K (or use the macro) to guard cancel roll
4/6 on wakeup to getup roll, also delays the wakeup by 9f (for everyone, and for both directions)
getups are not all the same length, see below
Scaling is wack, see below
669/8/7 carries dash momentum and is sometimes also a lower jump
screen scrolls slowly, when you reach the edge pushback acts like it is the corner
the first move in a combo can have different pushback than the same move would in a combo
backdashes have iframes
no extra throw invuln on neutral wakeup or after hit/blockstun, but you get it during while those are happening
almost everything forces a frame of wait on the frame you return to a neutral state
on neutral wakeup you can bypass that wait with a special move (not on air recovery/ect, not with backdashes)
2 frames of throw invincible forced wait frames on roll wakeups, can block during them (also has a wait frame)
p2 wins on same frame throws (including cmd grabs)
normal throws are i1, but they don't work as reversals due to the forced wait frame 
a lot of moves are the same advantage on hit and block, it isn't universal to all hitstun types though
characters reel during hitstun which can cause whiffs, especially for lows when back turned
air flip out seems to have 9 frames of juggleable hitstun universally
in a juggle state the standard air hit seems to have 7 frames of juggleable hitstun universally
air blockstun also takes 7 frames to become invincible
Stun is on almost everything, takes 800ish units to stun, see health/stun table below. 
mashing out of stun is a thing 
you can only be stunned once in a round
stun damage decreases by 1 every 4 frames, only stops in screen freeze/hitstop (global 4f timer)
hitting someone on the frame they take off from a jump causes the game to try to use the standing hit reel as the juggle hit effect, which can sometimes mean the wrong juggle effect comes out
Hitting T-Ai with Ishida's 214pp as she gets hit with her own 263kk drops her out of the 214pp while still taking damage. It softlocks the game if it kills
chain buffer for buttons starts with the active frame, doesn't need the button held
it determines the direction input right before when the move comes out 
if you just frame the final input of a special it doesn't go into the cancel buffer 
(623hp can be input early and still cancel, 623+hp can't be input early)
buffer window is 7f (if you don't just frame a special input), so 8f window total for most things
normal throws can't be buffered, only the normal will be buffered
tk special inputs are done on the 4th frame after pressing up (so 8,w,w,w,P) (at least for ishida and rika)
instant rising jump normals can be input on the same frame as you press up
2f jumpsquat, 1f wait, then rising jump normals start
the 4th frame after a jump can be canceled into grounded specials, so tk takes 1f longer
you also need to wait that extra frame on tk or you'll do an air normal instead of the special anyways
dash jumps skip the 2f jumpsquat
dash startup is 5f
667 must be input without hitting 4 or 8 (unless it is in the first 5f of the dash)
standard light fireballs (yuko, aya, rika's) have low hit/blockstun compared to medium/heavy versions
some fireballs have a fireball lockout timer that must run out before another can be used
most fireballs do not have the limit of only one on screen
frame data spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBhuhJMCrX1iMZBhXbhkfevynueO_iShj7ptp2grFf8/edit?usp=sharing  
there are regular throw loops against everyone without a special move reversal as everyone who can chase rolls
prejump is not throw invuln
round start has no buffer, not even for motions
dash stop seems like 8 frames of recovery universally (both 4 and 2 stops)


Getup stuff:
face down is (rika 2hp, 0 is +45):
	Ai -1
	Aya +1
	Naoko +1
	Rika +2
	Kumiko -1
	Shibata -3
face up is (kato 2hk):
	kato 56
	ishida 59
	naoko 58
	mika 53
	ai 61
	yuko 56
	aya 58
	rika 59
	kumiko 60
	shibata 59
this difference is also related to landing height differences between characters 
it also gets weird off juggles, shibata is 90kda (20j) off rika 66hk when normal is ~85kda (~27j)
(T-Ai and S-Naoko are the same as their regular versions) (frame data sheet has more values)


Crouch Stuff:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBhuhJMCrX1iMZBhXbhkfevynueO_iShj7ptp2grFf8/edit?usp=sharing
General rule is lights get +6 vs crouch, uppercuts and dunks get +2
Against Kumiko lights instead get +4, mediums get -2, and half gutshots get -2
crouching hit reel is wild too
For example Ishida's 66lk-hk (and 66lk-mp-hk) chain (midscreen):
Works on Kato, Ishida, Mika, Yuko, and Rika
Doesn't work on Naoko, Ai, and Kumiko
Crouch hurtbox often lowers during hitstun, causes ishida 66hk to whiff even off 66mp
rika 66hk juggles for 27f vs kato, 28f vs yuko, and 20f vs shibata


Scaling:
the game rounds weird, or all the scaling values are like 0.001 less
to calculate damage, use floor(baseDamage*(scalingValue-0.001))
(that isn't the in game formula, but it works out the same afaik)
scaling is based on cancels, it does not care about being in or out of a combo
link = no scaling (including juggles)
chain 1 = 0.65
chain 2+ = 0.60
(ex: lp chain mp chain hp chain hk, lp does 100%, mp does 65%, hp does 60%, hk does 60%)
cancel = 0.90
normal xx super = 0.70
special xx super = 0.80
for ishida's rekka every cancel is an additional 0.10 lower
(ex: normal xx 236lk xx 236mk xx 236hk does 1, 0.90, 0.80, 0.70)


Gameplay/Combos:
Rika:
5lk fastest button at i4
623lp is -6 with no grounded recovery (other than the 1f forced wait she can block during)
2lk 5mp 2hp, can add a 2mk vs some standing, can start with 2lp 2lk for extra punish damage
2hp likes to whiff on back turned standing characters 
2lk 5mp 5hp 236pp, can start with 2lp/66lp, skip 5hp on cr miku/rika/naoko
5lk instead of 2lk after jump ins
66lp-lk-hk/66mk-hk or just 66hk 662 delay 5mk 623lp
mid blah 66hk slight delay 5hp 623lp vs most (drops on kato/ishida/ai unless screen scroll slows them)
corner 66hk 662 mk 623hp (kato, mika, yuko, aya, shibata)
corner 66hk 66 623hp (ai, kumiko) (only worth if 623hp lands all hits)
66lp links into lights/mediums/2hp (only lights and 5mk vs crouching kumiko)
6mp unblockable, chains into 2mk 2hp
66lp/lk/mp/mk, lp/lk/2lp/2lk, j214p, 28-2hk, +ob
5hp/66hp 0ob/0oh (vs stand)
everything else (other than jump ins) -oh and -ob (vs stand)
2147hp is i13 at the fastest (counting from 7)
236p fireballs grow larger as they travel
after 623mp/hp you have 5 frames to input a super cancel (4 with 236+pp/kk, 5 with 236pp/kk)
crn standing Naoko 66lp-lk / 66mk-hp 623hp mk623lp
jmp lands 1f early, rj normals all land 2f early

Ishida:
lk 2mp mk 236lk 214pp
lk 2mp mk 236lk 236mk 236hk vs most, some dodge the 236mk when crouching
2369hk quick +15ob overhead (wait for 2nd lowest height or it is only +9ob/oh)
2369lk mid +1ob-ish, also +1oh-ish, can cancel into j236hk for big plus frames
66hk overhead --ob 
basically no reversal (236mk not, 214p mid/high only (also not i1))
214PP invuln until hit, first hit does no damage though so it trades terribly
236K cancels into other specials, works on block
has 4mk 6mk 6hk cmd normals
vs crouch (not kumiko) 2369lk-236hk 2lp 5lk link 214pp
vs stand 2369lk-236hk 2lp 5lk 5mp 5mk 236lk 214pp
vs crouch (not kumiko) (66lk 5lk)*inf, drops on some midscreen (3f window each 66lk) (does 350ish stun)
vs stand blah hp 66lk-mp-hk 66hp/623kk
you can do j236lk-236hk infinitely if you are clean with it (2f window on each j236lk)

Ai
throw 6623hp
throw hp better oki, less damage
623hp xx 263kk 623hp
crn 2lp 5lk 2mp 623lp 2lp 2lk 2hp 623hp (2hp(1) and skip 2lp vs some)
throw walk lk 623hp vs some 
mash p requires 4x of the same p input to trigger with no other buttons between them
623hp xx 263kk slight delay (or late xx 263kk) 5lk xx 623hp 
623hp xx 263kk cancel window is 5f (+8f of a buffer window, so 13f total leniency)
for some reason 263kk uses a hitbox then a throw box, but the throw box seems to hit always?
meaty 263kk real on no reversal characters
6hp does 400 stun 

Traitor Ai
Same as Ai mostly, except:
Everything cancels and chains
236K and 263KK are different
236KK replaces j623PP (bad trade)
throw 66mp623hp
meaty 263kk and 236kk real on no reversal characters

Yuko
crn 66lp-lk-mp-mk-hk xx 28hp 2mk28mp vs tall, do 28mp both times vs others
crn 2lk 2mk 28mp 2mk 28mp
crn stand jhk 5hp 2mk 28mp 2mk 28mp 

Kato
214kk has iframes, but not on frame 1
236lk is 18 frames total
66lp-lk-mp-mk 2lp5hp2hk, 241 damage
66lp=lk-mp-mk 2lp5mp236lp214kk vs stand only 
vs kato/shibata crouching, 2lp 5hp loops, 5hk 2mp5hp 2lp2mp5hp2hk
same two, 5hp 2lp5hp 2lp5hp2hk 

Naoko
vs crouching kato 2lp5mp 2lp 6 lkmpmkhphk236lp, 300 damage
vs crouching shibata 2lp5mp 2lp5mpmkhphk236lp, 282 damage
vs crouching aya 2lp5mp 2lk2mk2hk, 124 damage
vs standing 2lk5mk5hp5hk236lp, 200ish damage
6hp does 300 stun, still a bad move sadly
66hp is +2ob i5+19 overhead

Shibata
236hp is banned
236hp is +8 on block and +1 on gc roll, it is also the 2nd highest damage meterless move in the game 
(8+152, only higher is Kato's 624hp command grab at 184)
2mp2hp works on standing hit and crouching, 2mk2hp is crouch only
2lk2mp2hp214mp 236lp 254 (character specific?)
crn 2lk2mp2hp214lp 236lp 254
huge range on hp throw
can throw loop with p throw (high falling) 9hk 6hp, frame perfect timing to have the throw be inescapable

Kumiko
5lp xx 426pp is guaranteed unless then gc roll
66lp-lk2mp2mk426lk 6 5hp 257
5lk2mk426hk 6 5hp 221
5lk 2mp426hk 6 5hp 246
19f backdash 1-11 invuln

Fastest punish (other than normal throw, also counting the forced wait frame)
-4 Kato 5lp/2lp, Ishida 5lp/5lk/2lp/214pp, Mika 2lp, Ai 623lp/623hp/(Ai)263KK, Yuko 2mk
-5 Aya 5lp/2lp/n5lp/n2lp, rika 5lk, Shibata 5lp (2lp 1f slower, but hits crouching)
-6 Naoko/SNaoko 5lk/2lp/2lk, Kumiko 5lp/2lk/426lk

animations play 2f after the game logic updates
jumpsquat is 2f+1f wait, +1 more for tk specials

Ishida
move startup onhit onblock
66lp (can whiff 1st active behind skinny characters)
66lk (same issue as 66lp)
j236hk (lowest height +9 due to bug)
214k (counter isn't i1, the attack part is i1 though. 51/68/80 total on whiff)
backdash is 24 total, 1-16 invuln

Ram watch (mednafen, alt+D alt+4 shift+left until high work ram, enter to search for address)
high work ram: 
0xdba92 p1 life
0xdbbce p2 life
0xdba9e p1 bar
0xdbbda p2 bar
0xdba96 p1 stun 
0xdba98 p1 stun health
0xdbbd2 p2 stun
0xdbbd4 p2 stun health

bar is 800 units to fill 1 bar

Below this point the info is taken from looking at the memory directly while testing:
Health, Stun:
Kato 950, 850
Ishida 700, 800
Naoko 750, 750 (both)
Mika 750, 750
Ai 900, 950 (both)
Yuko 800, 750
Aya 800, 800
Rika 800, 750
Kumiko 850, 900
Shibata 1000, 950


esoteric weird stuff:
TAi 263kk can hit TAi the frame after Ishida's (j)214PP hits, if Ishida KOs TAi after she recovers it softlocks
Works with all self hitting attacks (Naoko 236KK, TAi 236K/263KK/236KK)
If you fill the input history table by mashing 312 then the game will crash if you buffer a move
