Sonic Council notes
System:
crouch hitstun is more than standing sometimes (standing hitstun works as expected), see below
crouch hitstun hurtboxes can shrink real low, see below
P+K to guard cancel roll
4/6 on wakeup to getup roll, also delays the wakeup a bit
Scaling is wack, see below
669/8/7 carries momentum and is sometimes a lower jump
screen scrolls slowly, when you reach the edge pushback acts like it is the corner
the first move in a combo can have different pushback than the same move in a combo
backdashes have iframes
a lot of moves are the same advantage on hit and block, it's arbitrary though
characters reel during hitstun which can cause whiffs, especially for lows when back turned
juggles, other than spin outs and spikes, seem to have about 10 frames of hitstun universally
stun might only be on heavies, or it is really hard to cause without them

Crouch Stuff:
For Ishida's 5lk 5lk link:
Works on Kato, Ishida, Naoko, Mika, Ai, Yuko, Aya, Rika, and Kumiko
For his 5lk 66lk link (and his 66lk 5lk link):
Works on Kato, Ishida, Naoko, Mika, Ai, Yuko, Aya, and Rika
Doesn't work on Kumiko
For Ishida's 66lk-hk chain (midscreen):
Works on Kato, Ishida, Mika, Yuko, and Rika
Doesn't work on Naoko, Ai, and Kumiko
Crouch hurtbox often lowers during hitstun, causes ishida 66hk to whiff even off 66mp
Current guess is that it depends on the animation, and it's character and move dependant

Scaling:
the game rounds weird, or all the scaling values are like 0.001 less
to calculate damage, use floor(baseDamage*(scalingValue-0.001))
(that isn't the in game formula, but it works out the same afaik)
scaling is based on cancels, it does not care about being in or out of a combo
link = no scaling (including juggles)
chain 1 = 0.65
chain 2+ = 0.60
(ex: lp chain mp chain hp chain hk, lp does 100%, mp does 65%, hp does 60%, hk does 60%)
cancel = 0.90
normal xx super = 0.70
special xx super = 0.80
for ishida's rekka every cancel is an additional 0.10 lower
(ex: normal xx 236lk xx 236mk xx 236hk does 1, 0.90, 0.80, 0.70)


Gameplay/Combos:
Rika:
2lk 5mp 2hp, can add a 2mk vs standing, can start with 2lp 2lk for extra punish damage
2lk 5mp 5hp 236pp, can start with 2lp, skip 5hp on cr miku/rika
5lk instead of 2lk after jump ins
66mk-hk or just 66hk 662 delay 5mk 623lp
66lp combos into lights 
6mp unblockable, chain into 2mk 2hp
66lp/lk/mp/mk, lp/lk/2lp/2lk, j214p, 28-2hk, +ob
5hp 0ob/0oh (vs stand)
everything else (other than jump ins) -oh and -ob

Ishida:
lk 2mp mk 236lk 214pp
lk 2mp mk 236lk 236mk 236hk vs most, some dodge the 236mk when crouching
2369hk quick +++ob overhead
2369lk mid +1ob-ish, also +1oh-ish, can cancel into j236hk for big plus frames
66hk overhead --ob 
basically no reversal (236mk not, 214p mid/high only (also maybe not i1))
214PP invuln until hit, first hit does no damage though so it trades terribly
236K cancels into other specials, works on block
has 4mk 6mk 6hk cmd normals
vs crouch (not kumiko) 2369lk-236hk 2lp 5lk link 214pp
vs stand 2369lk-236hk 2lp 5lk 5mp 5mk 236lk 214pp
vs crouch (not kumiko) (66lk 5lk)*inf 
vs stand blah hp 66lk-mp-hk 66hp/623kk
you can do j236lk-236hk infinitely if you are clean with it
236lk 236mk notes
Against everyone it whiffs from far


Ai
throw 6623hp
throw hp better oki, less damage
623hp xx 263kk 623hp

Traitor Ai
Same as Ai mostly, except:
Everything cancels and chains
236K and 263KK are different
236KK replaces j623PP
throw 66mp623hp

Yuko
crn 66lp-lk-mp-mk-hk xx 28hp 2mk28mp vs tall

Frame data from recordings:
Meter updates 1f before hit reactions, all startup may be 1 more than it really is
all recovery forces one frame of neutral (or neutral crouch) at the end, including blockstun/hitstun(?)
measured by in the mirror jump after hit/block then counting frames until they match animations
animations play 2f after the input
specials skip wait maybe idk
dash takes 2f before moves can start (this is included in the listed startup)
Ishida
