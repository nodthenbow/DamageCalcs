Power Quest for GBC
Move List / Strategy


Notation:
Assume facing right
L = B
H = A
X = L or H
(B sometimes gets confused for back, so because they function as light and heavy I'll use those letters instead) 
789 = ub u uf
456 =  b n f
123 = db d df
I will be using numpad notation, so just pretend you have s number pad overlayed
on top of your dpad (or stick), so 4 is back (left when on p1 side, right on p2
side), 6 is forwards, 2 is down, and so on. 



How to read this guide:
When a move is ###oh, that is referring to what it is on hit, ###ob is on block
+oh means it is a bit plus on hit (your character can act a bit before the opponent's if your character landed the hit)
++oh means it is very plus (enough to be able to combo another move after as a link, provided you are close enough)
The same applies to ###ob, except they will be blocking
0oh/0ob means you and your opponent are able to act on the same frame
KNDoh means that the move knocks down on hit
JGLoh means that the move launches the opponent in the air on hit, letting you juggle if you have time
Low in the notes means it must be blocked crouching
Overhead means it must be blocked standing
Crossup means it can hit behind the character (only noted for forwards jumping moves)
Cancel means you can cancel the move (skip the recover of the move) into a special or super
Chain means you can cancel the move into any move with the chain property
Bnb means bread and butter combo, aka a consistent combo that you can hitconfirm
Moves that JGL/KND often do that on air hit as well, others cause a flip out unless otherwise noted.



Notes on the game:
Damage is either slightly randomized or the health bars aren't consistent (or both).
The health and meter are measured more precisely than the bars show.
Stuns exist, you can shake out of them with directions and buttons.
There are no diagonals required in special motions and there are no charge motions.
Throws are on 4/6H. There is no way to tech or soften them. They all hit on frame 1.
There is no throw invuln after blockstun/hitstun or after wakeup.
Prejump is not throw invuln.
P1 seems to win throws if they are done on the same frame.
Moves seem to be +1 frame better on block than they are on hit unless they launch (JGL) or knockdown (KDN).
Some moves that JGL are not advantaged enough to juggle after.
Guard cancels that use normal move animations aren't cancelable, but the frame data seems unchanged. 
Guard cancels also cost a bar to use.
Supers don't seem to be invuln.
Whoever has more health wins the round in a timeout.
If health is tied the round is restarted with no one winning it.
The game lags fairly often.
Specials universally gain bar on whiff.
You do not gain bar for getting hit or blocking, only from using specials and landing hits.
You can negative edge specials.
Juggles have a limit of 3 hits (including the launcher), supers can bypass this limit.
When juggle limit is reached the last will make them KND or flip out, unless it is a super.
All moves force stand on hit, unless they JGL or KDN obviously.
There is chip and chip kills.



Max
L ++oh ++ob cancel chain
6L ++oh ++ob cancel
2L ++oh ++ob low cancel chain
H 0oh 0ob cancel
2H KDNoh --ob low cancel
6H ++oh ++ob overhead, if 2nd hit whiffs --oh/ob
7/8/9L overhead, active until land
7/8/9H overhead, can crossup

Specials
26X -ob -oh only speed changes with strength, fireball
24L JGLoh +ob do this move a lot
24H 0oh +ob a worse 24L, JGL on air hit
62L KDNoh --ob might have invuln, light DP
62H KDNoh --ob has invuln, first two hits JGL, last hit KND

Supers
2424X KDNoh --ob rush punch super, hits before the flash, JGL on air hit
6262X KDNoh --ob dp super, hits before the flash, JGL on air hit 

Guard Cancels
42L same as 62H
42H same as 2H

Fastest meter gain on whiff 62L
Bnb 2L2L H xx 24L 62H/2626X

Strategy
Standard shoto fireball DP game plan, until you get close then do 24L a ton. 


Speed
L ++oh ++ob chain/cancel
2L ++oh ++ob low chain/cancel
H +oh +ob cancel
2H KDNon +ob low cancel
6H -oh -ob overhead always punishable by at least a throw
7/9L overhead active until land can crossup
8L overhead active until land
7/8/9H overhead can crossup
any jump H other than 8/5H KNDoh N/Aob air to air throw

Specials
24X JGLoh --ob air okay, distance and startup change with strength, 24L is much easier to juggle off of
26X --oh --ob bad move, H hits twice, very active (does not interact with fireballs), KDN on air hit
j86X ++oh ++ob (lowest possible) overhead, angle changes with strength, KDN on air hit

Supers
6262X KDNoh --ob only last hit KDN, if it whiffs (it will) --oh, JGL on air hit
2424X KDNoh --ob kick super, use this one, hits before the flash, JGL on air hit

Guard Cancels
42L same as 24L
42H same as 2H

Fastest meter gain on whiff instant air 86L
Bnb (walk between Ls) 2L L H 24H/2424X (can sometimes juggle 2L after 24H)

Strategy
Use your strong walk speed and good range to get in, then abuse your 86X and 2L for fast high/low mixups that also also plus on block. Use movement to avoid jump ins, or predict them with 8L because you have no anti airs (air to airs are not great either). 42L guard cancel will often be your only anti air option, so try to keep some bar up.


Gong
L 0oh +ob cancel
2L ++oh ++ob low cancel chain
H +ob +oh cancel
6H ++oh ++ob overhead +oh/+ob if second hit whiffs
2H KDNoh -ob low cancel
7/8/9L crossup overhead
7/9H overhead
8H overhead
any jump H other than 8/5H KNDoh N/Aob air to air throw

Specials
24X --oh --ob absorbs fireballs to gain a lot of bar, KDN on air hit
26X KDNoh --ob has invuln, L faster startup (can combo from H as a cancel)
62X KDNoh N/Aob a command grab with a whiff, follows normal throw rules (has more range than normal throw)

Supers
2626X KNDoh --ob hit super, hits before the flash
6262X KNDoh N/Aob hits before the flash, grab super, has whiff, follows throw rules

Guard Cancels
42L same as H
42H same as 2H

Fastest meter gain on whiff 24L
Bnb 2L 2L 2H or 2L H 2626X

Strategy
Use 2H to get a knockdown and then do a strike throw mixup with 62X and 2L. L can work as an anti air, but the window is tight. You may be better off blocking and trying to 62X them as they land. A spaced meaty 62X can only be avoided with invincible reversals, and can be looped in the corner.


Axe
L ++oh ++ob chain cancel
2L ++oh ++ob low chain cancel
H +oh +ob cancel
6H ++oh ++ob overhead 0oh/+ob if second hit whiffs
2H KNDoh --ob low slide, easy to space it so it is safe
7/8/9L overhead
7/8/9H overhead crossup

Specials
28L JGLoh --ob very few iframes, can only juggle off it if it's meaty or it hits them high in the air
28H KNDoh --ob goes higher and hits twice, first hit JGL, second hit KND
24X -oh -ob fireball, only speed changes, KND on air hit
26X --oh --ob blanka ball usually safe due to bouncing away, KND on air hit

Supers
2424X -oh -ob frame data depends on number of hits, fireball super, negates regular fireballs, JGL on air hit
268X KNDoh --ob dp super, hits before the flash, very fast startup

Guard Cancels
42L same as 28H
42H same as 2H

Fastest meter gain on whiff 28L
Bnb 2L 2L H 26H, cut a 2L to get in range for 2424X

Strategy
Use 2H, 26X, 6H, and 24X to land plenty of small hits. 28X and 268X are great anti airs, 28L often giving juggles into 26X, 28X, or 268X.


Lon
L ++oh ++ob chain cancel
2L ++oh ++ob low chain cancel
H -oh 0ob cancel
6H ++oh ++ob overhead
2H KNDoh +ob low cancel
7/9L overhead
7/9H overhead
8L overhead
8H overhead
any jump H other than 8/5H KNDoh N/Aob air to air throw

Specials
24L JGLoh +ob overhead, can hop over fireballs, can not be cancelled into
24H ++oh ++ob overhead, can not be cancelled into, KND on air hit
26X --oh --ob fireball, hitbox is not as high as it looks
62L -oh -ob not invuln but it still is a great AA, very fast but not frame 1, KDN on air hit
62H KNDoh --ob if the second hit whiffs --oh, KND on air hit

Supers 
2626X KNDoh --ob hits before the flash, JGL on air hit
2424X +oh --ob overhead, JGL on air hit

Guard Cancels
42L KNDoh --ob unique elbow move
42H same as 2H

Fastest meter gain on whiff 62L
Bnb 2L 2L 2H (2L 2L H 2626X for a super confirm)

Strategy
Use 24L a lot. 62L is your anti air. 26X is not a great fireball, but it can be useful to lead a 24L with. After a stun use jH 2L H 62H for damage. After 24L jThrow for damage and 62L for reliability


Borot
H It's 0ish on hit and block, not actually sure
Borot has nothing else, not even a throw, a jump, or the ability to block. 

Strategy
Lose.



My personal tier list (for competitive play, ordered in tiers):
A: Max, Speed
B: Lon, Axe
C: Gong
Borot: Borot

Max is all around solid but gets free confirms off any hit. Great DP and easy to use supers, but them mixup is limited to throws and a meh overhead, and them guard cancels are both unsafe.
Speed has very strong mixups and pressure, plus solid range and great movement speed. Only downside is the complete lack of a reversal outside of throw and no real anti airs.
Lon has great pressure and can restart pressure with them 24L, but them throw barely being plus, the lack of invuln moves, and low damage without bar hold them back. 
Axe has good zoning and a lot of high coverage moves, but terrible damage, the worst reversal, and terrible confirms even with bar hold them back. 
Gong just doesn't have a good enough neutral to ever really start them mixups. They can loop command grabs on Speed and Lon in the corner, but Gong will usually lose before getting them to the corner.
Borot literally can't block, or throw.



Esoterics:
Gong is the fastest to land after jumping, then Max, and the other 3 are tied for 3rd.
Backwards jumps go farther than forwards jumps.
Using Max's 24L 3 times in one combo causes the third to launch them way higher than normal (but because the juggle limit was reached the combo ends there).
There's no Speed L walk infinite in the corner, at best it's a frame trap loop.
Gong's 24X can negate multiple hits of Axe's 2424X super fireball, but not enough to negate it completely.
Axe's 26X goes over only Max's fireball.
Special move input priority is 62/28 > fireballs > 24 > 26 > 86
Axe's 2424X will negate some hits if used on itself, then they pass through the other
Only Axe and Max's fireballs don't interact
