mini guide:
	main oki is drive rush 6mp or 2lk, because 6mp is i20
	throw loop with dash, shimmy with dash walk back (not vs bigger throw range chars)
	5hk and 5hp (into dr blah or 236hk) are the main whiff punishers
	with 4+ od bar:
		poke with mp and 2mk buffered into dr
		any fireball with a drive rush behind it
		focus on getting them to the corner over going into 236236p
		try to get a 236236p with 3/4 od bar and the corner
		always do dr oki for the mixup
		dive kick kinda good
	with 3-4 od:
		236[p] walk behind to wait for bar to regen
		mk, hk, and well spaced mp with 214lp or 236p buffered are your main pokes
		drive rush oki is still worth it midscreen 
		try to conserve stocks if you have them
		dive kick still kinda good
	with <3 od:
		worth it to spend stocks to stay out of burnout
		236236p is your best reversal
		dive kicks are going to be a bit too risky
	in the corner 4hk is a solid, easy, single hit confirm (4hkhk 623mk/236236p)
	jlk and jmk are your crossups, jhp is the lowest reaching, jhk is the farthest reaching
	2hp is an easy hitconfirm button, but ch and dr confirms are your main source of damage
	623k is your main AA, 4hk works but is worse, 236236p is great if you have fast hands
	corner is very good for her, worth doing 236lk enders to get.
	stocks are very useful, 236236p is worth routing into (easier in the corner)
	main confirm into 236236p out of corner is with a ch into 2mp or dr cancel
	in corner light confirms into 236kk jmp 236236p are the most reliable
	236[p] is meh as oki, but good for lockdown in neutral
	can't jump 236p on reaction, can jump 236[p], but they have to guess if it will be charged
	very easy to use anti fireball moves against her
	236[mp] most useful fan, midscreen-ish dr 6mp vs dr 2lk vs dr throw
	fan mixups are beaten by being proactive or getting too close, drive reversal also kills it usually
	s214lp safe for real (-2), js214p/pp has more blockstun too (can be plus) and combos on hit
	burnout loop with 2mp s214lp, or trade loop with lp 214lp
	burnout stagger pressure is better though, every normal but 5mk, 2mk, and 2hk is plus
	(s)236[pp]6p is amazing for lockdown if you can ever sneak it in 
	
random notes:
	5lp has more hitstun than the other lights, enough to combo into 214lp, 236kk, and dr 2lk 
	5lk is only there for the lklklk tc, lklklk is usually safe on block at least
	4hkhk is hitconfirmable, also the input buffer after it lasts from the 3rd hit to the end 
	really hard to get into lvl1 outside the corner, 2mp/lp ch 2mp 236236p best bet
	s236236p works off almost everything, it is great damage and refreshes stocks, but no oki
	s623hk has less range issues than 623hk does 
	4hk 2f window to manually meaty enough for link into 2mp
	jmp juggles as an air to air is not a reliable AA, but with stocks it is rewarding 
	you can hold the 6p of 236[pp] 6p instead of repressing 6p
	mp/2mk dr 2lp no gap, +3ob, same with hp dr 4hk/2lp
	236p loses to strikes, 236[p] is a fireball, ex always ex fb (1 hit per fan tho)
	almost everything gets dr 6mp oki, except 236236p, 214214p, 623kk, 236mk, and 236hk
	623kk gets dash +2 near corner only
	236mk/hk get dash throw range oki everywhere
	236236p is +26, get dr 2mp midscreen, 2lk 4hk perfect meaty in corner
	214214p is +19, get dash +1 no throw oki (CA is +20, still no throw)
	dr 2lp2lp 5lklklk214p safe jump (+42), same with dr 4hk lklklk214p

	corner vs crouch stuff can do 214mp 623mk as the ender 

counterhit/punish counter:
	anything into 2mp is useful for getting into 236236p without corner or dr 
	ch lp/2lp 2mp 214pp/ect (single hit confirmable)

useless stuff:
	6mp spikes in juggles +16kda
	pc hk walk hp 214hp 236lk midscreen for less than 2mp damage route 
	corner 214pp 236kk jmp 236236k 623lk can work, but gets less damage than the sane combos
	vs st pc 236[mp] lp walk anything, less damage than any normal combo
	lklk forces stand, but it is -2 on hit so lol, maybe with fan stuff this can be useful 
	214214p no cinematic 623hk
