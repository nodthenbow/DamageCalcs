Siegfried punish/combos list
Unreliable means literally unreliable on a system level, not on a human level. There are three sources of this unreliability:
UN1, it's matchup or position specific (srshB (ssr) 22_88BBB only work on some characters and only at some angles and positions)
UN2, it's a random mechanic (Tira mood shifts for example, Siegfried doesn't have any)
UN3, it's impacted by the input shifting glitch the input handler itself has (https://youtu.be/lCHN7ptwuvU This only matters on 1 frame links, but Siegfried has those)
The unreliability of UN1 can be made reliable by knowing the situation well enough, so I'm only going to say this when it is way too finiky to confirm in almost any situation without setplay. UN2 and UN3 are just random, you have no control over them past deciding to take that risk or not. UN3 has about a 30% failure rate if you assume you have perfect execution and timing, UN2 is move specific (and Siegfried doesn't have any move with this anyways).
Notation:
789 u/b u u/f
456   b n f
123 d/b d d/f
Assume facing right, 4 is back, 5 is neutral, 6 is forwards, ect. A is horizontal, B is vertical, K is kick, G is guard, and they are whatever button they are mapped to in the controller settings.
xY means slide from X to Y, 66/22/ect means 8 way run in that direction (pressing the direction twice then holding it is the shortcut to 8 way run, so that's why that notation is written that way). X:Y means a just frame (you flash blue, the window is usually tighter than normal). X_Y means X or Y. w! means wallsplat happens there. [X] means hold X and ]X[ means release X (usually it's implied and not written). bt means back turned (aka when your back is towards the opponent). LH means lethal hit, GI means guard impact, fc means full/from crouch (while crouching do the input), ch means counterhit, nc means natural combo (always combos on hit), ncc means natural counterhit combo (only combos on counterhit). X+Y means press X and Y at the same time (4X/6X/ect implies together (direction can be pressed well before the attack though), XY does not imply that).

Siegfried specific notation:
srsh = (stance) reverse side hold, the stance you can do manually with 6B+K
ssh = (stance) side hold, the stance you can do manually with 4B+K
sch = (stance) chief hold, the stance you can do manually with 2_8B+K
sbh = (stance) base hold, the stance you can do manually with B+K
iagA = a:g:A, a move Siegfried has
DL = dark legacy

General note, any combo that ends on 3B or 33B can replace that with a:B for the same damage and better oki, or the other way around to get around UN3 at times.
General note on buffers, iagA at reversal timings require a[G] to be buffered, if G is released then you can not get iagA. The same is not true for a:B, which must be a buffered A and a timed B, and is UN3 as a reversal, however, you do not need to do a:5B, so any B move may be used (not including wrB, 22B, ect, but yes including b6 and b:4).

Meterless, no DL:

Dark legacy stuff
6A+B 6 a:B, 61, removes DL
fc3[K], 69, i14 crouching punish, removes DL
Lethal hits in DL
3[B] G 66[A+B] 3B, 91, on counterhit
66[A+B] 3B, 80, on whiff punish
srsh[K] srshB b:4, 67, on standing guard
srshB 3[B] schA+B, 86, on crouching guard
sshK 6[B] schK[K] schA[A] srshA+B, 83, on counterhit

Meter stuff
i16 punish, 236A+B+K, 39
i20 punish, super, 80
ch 3[B] super, 83, really the only way into super that makes it do more than 3 extra damage
juggles like sbhB and sch[B] that go into 4A+B or 66[A+B] go into super, and schK[K] spin stun goes into super for at most 10 extra damage
All commbos into super off stuns that go into 6[B] or 33[B] do more damage using 33[B]
236A+B+K almost always loses damage and oki, these are the exceptions:
ch 66KK 236A+B+K, 60
3A 236A+B+K, 45
fc1A+G 236A+B+K, 44 UN1

Soulcharge stuff
3[B] schkA+B 4A+BB, 88, uses about half of SC
3[B] schkA+B 4A+BA, 83, uses about a quarter of SC
b6B schB, 64, uses about a quarter
ch b6B schkA+B, 4A+BB, 83, uses a lot
ch b6B schK[K] schA+B, 74, uses about half
66KB schA+B, 85, uses about half
LH 6A+G 66KB schA+B, 95
You get the idea, Siegfried's SC sucks and he doesn't have the meter gain to use it anyways

Wall combos
(not on astaroth)
Full wall 
w! 6AA w! 6[B] schK[K] schA[A] srshA+B, 143 started with ch 6AA, high splats only, works most reliably with wall closer on the left
w! 6[B] schK[K] schA+B w! iwr[B] sch[A] sshA+B 4A+BA, 143 started with ch 6AA, works off lower splats, same angle is best
w! 66KK w! (either iwr[B] or 6[B] route), 127 off ch 6AA, works off every janky splat (which is most splats he has)
3[B] (schK[K]) w! schK[K] schA+B w! iwr[B] route, 106 (89), only option with 3B splats
ch 3[B] A+B w! b6 66B, 104, it's a bad splat

Half wall
3[B] delay schk(long delay)[K] w! schA+B w! iwr[B] schA+B, RO, really finiky but your only option
w! 6K or 66KK w! iwr[B] schA+B, 6K when wall is closer to the left, 66K when closer to the right

Big half wall
same as half wall, but you don't need to always do the 3[B] delays

Splats and best next hit (usually)
agA, left, 66K
juggle into agA, left/front, 6AA
22_88A, left, 6[B]
ch 66KK, front, 6AA
3a4 left 6AA
schA+B, front 6AA, (usually this is after schK[K] twirls, so do the iwr[B] route)
BB/bgB, front, 66KK
ch 6K, front, 6[B]
sshK, front, 66K (ch wrA sshK and ch [A] sshK)
fc1A+G, back, 66KK
3B stuff all do specific combos

Asta wall combos (he hits facing the wall when others wouldn't, so most of the other combos don't work)
Full wall
6AA w! 3A w! 6[B] route, 126
ch 66KK and ch 6K w! 6AA w! either route, 121
Do not try to do the second splat with schA+B, it ends the combo

Half wall and big half wall
ch 66KK rings out now, so try into that
No double splat combos off 3[B], don't do it
w! 3A w! 66KK

Ringout combos
3[B] schKK left
ch 6[B] schK[K] schA+B front (also for 44A and schB LH this is better than 3[B] schA+B)
ch 6[B] schKK 4A right
sbhB 66A+B front
sbhB iagA left
LH 6A+G 66KK front
LH sbhB A+B right
LH sbhB 44K front
srshB (or ch 6AB) DL 6A+B iagA/66A+B left/front
ch [A] sshK front
ch wr[A] sshK front

Character exclusive
NM: ch wr[B] sch[A] sshA+B 4A+BA 93 (works on most from side)
NM/Mits/Asta/Cerv/Ralph/Maxi/Voldo/Sieg/Yoshi/Talim/Zas/Hilde/Haoh/Sets: b:4 66A+B, 76 
NM/Mits/Asta/Cerv/Maxi/Voldo/Sieg/Yoshi/Talim/Hilde/Sets: b:4 44A+B 72 (ukemi trap)
Most 66A a:B, 54 

Punish Taki:
6KK sidestep before second hit 44[B]
1KK sidestep before second hit 33[B]/dl66[A+B]
super 66[A] sbhK 50 post flash if not stepping, B+K sbhK a:B 41 if stepping, RE 35+RPS, GI +8
