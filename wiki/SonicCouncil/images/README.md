All images should take the form of "Charactername-(Modifiers)MoveInputInNumpad.gif" with the modifiers being entirely lowercase and the button inputs being uppercase.  
Omit the 5 unless there are no modifiers  
Example: "Naoko-cat236LK.gif", "TAi-5HK.gif", "Kato-dashHK.gif"  
If multiple inputs perform the exact same move list the simplest input that starts with the direction order listed here 564231897, same with button inputs in this order HP MP LP HK MK LK 
If the move can be done with any punch, and there is no difference between strengths, use P, for kicks use K  
Example: Naoko's no cat recall move (214K/236K) would be called "Naoko-nocat236K.gif" as 3 is earlier than 1 in the direction ordering and all strengths of K perform the same move.  
Example: Pretending that Rika's MP and HP throws are the exact same (they are not, meter gain differs), it would be called "Rika-6HP.gif"  
Mash move inputs are written like "Ai-mashHP.gif"  
Half circles are written as 426 or 624.  
Ai's unblockable demon (and TAi's bomb) is 263KK (because that's the input)
Otherwise just try to remain consistent between characters  

List of modifiers: 
State | What to type | Order    |  Relevant Characters  | Note
-----------|---------|--------|---------------------|------------
Jumping    | jump      | 4 | All | Use this if it is the same as the falling diagonal jump version of the jump normal
Dashing       | dash | 2   | All | The actual dash start should be included in the gif
Rising        | rising  | 3   | All   | Used for rising jump normals
Cat      | cat     |    1    | Naoko    | Use when the move requires the cat
Pen      | pen     | 1    | Aya | Use when the move requires the pen 
No cat       | nocat     |   1     | Naoko                 | Use when the move requires not having the cat
No pen        | nopen |   1     | Aya | Use when the move requires not having the pen

Order determines what modifier comes first ("Aya-pendashrisingjumpHP.gif")  

Character names are as follows: Kato, Ishida, Naoko, Mika, Ai, Yuko, Aya, Rika, Kumiko, Shibata, SNaoko, TAi  
SNaoko is Shadow Naoko, TAi is Traitorous Ai.  
Do not use any other spellings.

Ideally the gif should be recorded in bizhawk 2.10 with the hitbox viewer running with view>window size set to 2x and these display settings:  
User Prescale: 1x  
Maintain Aspect Ratio: On  
Aspect Ratio Selection: Use 1:1 pixel size  
Scaling Filter: None  
Auto Prescale: Off  
Expand pixels by integers only: On  
Cropping: all 0
